## ðŸš€ About the Project

The **Zakat Application** is in development to become a secure and transparent Zakat donation platform. Currently, the project has integrated **Firebase** for initial backend support, allowing us to manage authentication, user data and real-time updates. As we expand, blockchain and additional database functionality will enhance the transparency, global efficiency, traceability and security of Zakat transactions.
